# Db Dependent relations #

Predefined relation constants `R00`, `R01` are database independent and, therefore are calculated before database creation. `R10` and `R11`, however, are infinite relations, which makes them impossible to implement as sets of tuples. Yet, for any given database instance there are finite incarnations of `R10`, `R11` which satisfy all RL axioms. Consequently, `R10` and `R11` are not defined until the very last base relation is added to the database. In other words, you can use `R00`, `R01` in relational expression within database definition file, but not `R10` and `R11`. Likewise, outer union and complement leverage the `R11` definition and, therefore, can't be used in the database definition file.

Perhaps more attention should be dedicated to this matter, elevating `R10` and `R11` to  genuine predicates.
