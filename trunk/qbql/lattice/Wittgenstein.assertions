(Blocks ^ D) v Size = Large.

(Blocks ^ C) v Shape = Cube & C = B -> (Blocks ^ A) v Shape = Cube.
------------------------------FALSE! because C and B are constants, not variables


((Blocks ^ A) v Size) ^ ((Blocks ^ C) v Shape) = Small ^ Cube.

(Blocks ^ D) v (Size ^ Shape) = Large ^ Cube -> (Blocks ^ D) v Size = Large.

BlockD ^ Large < BlockD ^ Large'.
BlockD ^ Cube < BlockD ^ Cube'.
